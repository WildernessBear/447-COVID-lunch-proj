# Covid Lunch Project

A lot of this iteration was figuring out how git works and learning Django. At this point, the program does not run. 

## To run the program:
1. Navigate to LunchProject/mysite on your command line
2. Enter the command: python manage.py runserver (some terminals will need the command python3)
3. Navigate to the local link in your browser
4. Add /admin to the link

## Dependencies:
- python3
- asgiref == 3.2.10
- Django == 3.1.2
- pytz == 2020.1
- sqlparse == 0.3.1

## To run the tests:
Tests are forthcoming.
